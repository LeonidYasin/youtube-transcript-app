{"success":true,"video_id":"qp0HIF3SfI4","transcript":"How do you explain\nwhen things don't go as we assume?\nOr better, how do you explain\nwhen others are able to achieve things\nthat seem to defy all of the assumptions?\nFor example:\nWhy is Apple so innovative?\nYear after year, after year,\nthey're more innovative\nthan all their competition.\nAnd yet, they're just a computer company.\nThey're just like everyone else.\nThey have the same access\nto the same talent,\nthe same agencies,\nthe same consultants, the same media.\nThen why is it that they seem\nto have something different?\nWhy is it that Martin Luther King\nled the Civil Rights Movement?\nHe wasn't the only man\nwho suffered in pre-civil rights America,\nand he certainly wasn't\nthe only great orator of the day.\nWhy him?\nAnd why is it that the Wright brothers\nwere able to figure out controlled,\npowered man flight\nwhen there were certainly other teams\nwho were better qualified,\nbetter funded --\nand they didn't achieve\npowered man flight,\nand the Wright brothers beat them to it.\nThere's something else at play here.\nAbout three and a half years ago,\nI made a discovery.\nAnd this discovery profoundly changed\nmy view on how I thought the world worked,\nand it even profoundly changed the way\nin which I operate in it.\nAs it turns out, there's a pattern.\nAs it turns out, all the great inspiring\nleaders and organizations in the world,\nwhether it's Apple or Martin Luther King\nor the Wright brothers,\nthey all think, act and communicate\nthe exact same way.\nAnd it's the complete opposite\nto everyone else.\nAll I did was codify it,\nand it's probably\nthe world's simplest idea.\nI call it the golden circle.\nWhy? How? What?\nThis little idea explains\nwhy some organizations and some leaders\nare able to inspire where others aren't.\nLet me define the terms really quickly.\nEvery single person, every single\norganization on the planet\nknows what they do, 100 percent.\nSome know how they do it,\nwhether you call it\nyour differentiated value proposition\nor your proprietary process or your USP.\nBut very, very few people or organizations\nknow why they do what they do.\nAnd by \"why\" I don't mean\n\"to make a profit.\"\nThat's a result. It's always a result.\nBy \"why,\" I mean: What's your purpose?\nWhat's your cause? What's your belief?\nWhy does your organization exist?\nWhy do you get out of bed in the morning?\nAnd why should anyone care?\nAs a result, the way we think, we act,\nthe way we communicate\nis from the outside in, it's obvious.\nWe go from the clearest thing\nto the fuzziest thing.\nBut the inspired leaders\nand the inspired organizations --\nregardless of their size,\nregardless of their industry --\nall think, act and communicate\nfrom the inside out.\nLet me give you an example.\nI use Apple because they're easy\nto understand and everybody gets it.\nIf Apple were like everyone else,\na marketing message from them\nmight sound like this:\n\"We make great computers.\nThey're beautifully designed,\nsimple to use and user friendly.\nWant to buy one?\"\n\"Meh.\"\nThat's how most of us communicate.\nThat's how most marketing\nand sales are done,\nthat's how we communicate interpersonally.\nWe say what we do,\nwe say how we're different or better\nand we expect some sort of a behavior,\na purchase, a vote, something like that.\nHere's our new law firm:\nWe have the best lawyers\nwith the biggest clients,\nwe always perform for our clients.\nHere's our new car:\nIt gets great gas mileage,\nit has leather seats.\nBuy our car.\nBut it's uninspiring.\nHere's how Apple actually communicates.\n\"Everything we do,\nwe believe in challenging the status quo.\nWe believe in thinking differently.\nThe way we challenge the status quo\nis by making our products\nbeautifully designed,\nsimple to use and user friendly.\nWe just happen to make great computers.\nWant to buy one?\"\nTotally different, right?\nYou're ready to buy a computer from me.\nI just reversed\nthe order of the information.\nWhat it proves to us is\nthat people don't buy what you do;\npeople buy why you do it.\nThis explains why\nevery single person in this room\nis perfectly comfortable buying\na computer from Apple.\nBut we're also perfectly comfortable\nbuying an MP3 player from Apple,\nor a phone from Apple,\nor a DVR from Apple.\nAs I said before,\nApple's just a computer company.\nNothing distinguishes them structurally\nfrom any of their competitors.\nTheir competitors are equally qualified\nto make all of these products.\nIn fact, they tried.\nA few years ago, Gateway\ncame out with flat-screen TVs.\nThey're eminently qualified\nto make flat-screen TVs.\nThey've been making\nflat-screen monitors for years.\nNobody bought one.\nDell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,\nand they make great quality products,\nand they can make perfectly\nwell-designed products --\nand nobody bought one.\nIn fact, talking about it now,\nwe can't even imagine\nbuying an MP3 player from Dell.\nWhy would you buy one\nfrom a computer company?\nBut we do it every day.\nPeople don't buy what you do;\nthey buy why you do it.\nThe goal is not to do business\nwith everybody who needs what you have.\nThe goal is to do business with people\nwho believe what you believe.\nHere's the best part:\nNone of what I'm telling you\nis my opinion.\nIt's all grounded\nin the tenets of biology.\nNot psychology, biology.\nIf you look at a cross-section\nof the human brain,\nfrom the top down,\nthe human brain is actually broken\ninto three major components\nthat correlate perfectly\nwith the golden circle.\nOur newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,\nour neocortex,\ncorresponds with the \"what\" level.\nThe neocortex is responsible\nfor all of our rational\nand analytical thought and language.\nThe middle two sections make up\nour limbic brains,\nand our limbic brains are responsible\nfor all of our feelings,\nlike trust and loyalty.\nIt's also responsible\nfor all human behavior,\nall decision-making,\nand it has no capacity for language.\nIn other words, when we communicate\nfrom the outside in,\nyes, people can understand vast\namounts of complicated information\nlike features and benefits\nand facts and figures.\nIt just doesn't drive behavior.\nWhen we can communicate\nfrom the inside out,\nwe're talking directly\nto the part of the brain\nthat controls behavior,\nand then we allow people to rationalize it\nwith the tangible things we say and do.\nThis is where gut decisions come from.\nSometimes you can give somebody\nall the facts and figures,\nand they say, \"I know\nwhat all the facts and details say,\nbut it just doesn't feel right.\"\nWhy would we use that verb,\nit doesn't \"feel\" right?\nBecause the part of the brain\nthat controls decision-making\ndoesn't control language.\nThe best we can muster up is,\n\"I don't know. \nIt just doesn't feel right.\"\nOr sometimes you say you're leading\nwith your heart or soul.\nI hate to break it to you,\nthose aren't other body parts\ncontrolling your behavior.\nIt's all happening here\nin your limbic brain,\nthe part of the brain that controls\ndecision-making and not language.\nBut if you don't know\nwhy you do what you do,\nand people respond\nto why you do what you do,\nthen how will you ever get people\nto vote for you,\nor buy something from you,\nor, more importantly, be loyal\nand want to be a part\nof what it is that you do.\nThe goal is not just to sell\nto people who need what you have;\nthe goal is to sell to people\nwho believe what you believe.\nThe goal is not just\nto hire people who need a job;\nit's to hire people\nwho believe what you believe.\nI always say that, you know,\nif you hire people just because they can\ndo a job, they'll work for your money,\nbut if they believe what you believe,\nthey'll work for you with blood\nand sweat and tears.\nNowhere else is there a better example\nthan with the Wright brothers.\nMost people don't know\nabout Samuel Pierpont Langley.\nAnd back in the early 20th century,\nthe pursuit of powered man flight\nwas like the dot com of the day.\nEverybody was trying it.\nAnd Samuel Pierpont Langley\nhad, what we assume,\nto be the recipe for success.\nEven now, you ask people,\n\"Why did your product\nor why did your company fail?\"\nand people always give\nyou the same permutation\nof the same three things:\nunder-capitalized, the wrong people,\nbad market conditions.\nIt's always the same three things,\nso let's explore that.\nSamuel Pierpont Langley\nwas given 50,000 dollars\nby the War Department\nto figure out this flying machine.\nMoney was no problem.\nHe held a seat at Harvard\nand worked at the Smithsonian\nand was extremely well-connected;\nhe knew all the big minds of the day.\nHe hired the best minds money could find\nand the market conditions were fantastic.\nThe New York Times\nfollowed him around everywhere,\nand everyone was rooting for Langley.\nThen how come we've never heard\nof Samuel Pierpont Langley?\nA few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,\nOrville and Wilbur Wright,\nthey had none of what we consider\nto be the recipe for success.\nThey had no money;\nthey paid for their dream\nwith the proceeds from their bicycle shop.\nNot a single person\non the Wright brothers' team\nhad a college education,\nnot even Orville or Wilbur.\nAnd The New York Times\nfollowed them around nowhere.\nThe difference was,\nOrville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,\nby a purpose, by a belief.\nThey believed that if they could\nfigure out this flying machine,\nit'll change the course of the world.\nSamuel Pierpont Langley was different.\nHe wanted to be rich,\nand he wanted to be famous.\nHe was in pursuit of the result.\nHe was in pursuit of the riches.\nAnd lo and behold, look what happened.\nThe people who believed\nin the Wright brothers' dream\nworked with them with blood\nand sweat and tears.\nThe others just worked for the paycheck.\nThey tell stories of how every time\nthe Wright brothers went out,\nthey would have to take\nfive sets of parts,\nbecause that's how many times\nthey would crash before supper.\nAnd, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,\nthe Wright brothers took flight,\nand no one was there\nto even experience it.\nWe found out about it a few days later.\nAnd further proof that Langley\nwas motivated by the wrong thing:\nthe day the Wright brothers took flight,\nhe quit.\nHe could have said,\n\"That's an amazing discovery, guys,\nand I will improve\nupon your technology,\" but he didn't.\nHe wasn't first, he didn't get rich,\nhe didn't get famous, so he quit.\nPeople don't buy what you do;\nthey buy why you do it.\nIf you talk about what you believe,\nyou will attract those\nwho believe what you believe.\nBut why is it important to attract\nthose who believe what you believe?\nSomething called the law\nof diffusion of innovation,\nif you don't know the law,\nyou know the terminology.\nThe first 2.5% of our population\nare our innovators.\nThe next 13.5% of our population\nare our early adopters.\nThe next 34% are your early majority,\nyour late majority and your laggards.\nThe only reason these people\nbuy touch-tone phones\nis because you can't buy\nrotary phones anymore.\n(Laughter)\nWe all sit at various places\nat various times on this scale,\nbut what the law of diffusion\nof innovation tells us\nis that if you want mass-market success\nor mass-market acceptance of an idea,\nyou cannot have it\nuntil you achieve this tipping point\nbetween 15 and 18 percent\nmarket penetration,\nand then the system tips.\nI love asking businesses,\n\"What's your conversion on new business?\"\nThey love to tell you,\n\"It's about 10 percent,\" proudly.\nWell, you can trip\nover 10% of the customers.\nWe all have about 10% who just \"get it.\"\nThat's how we describe them, right?\nThat's like that gut feeling,\n\"Oh, they just get it.\"\nThe problem is: How do you\nfind the ones that get it\nbefore doing business\nversus the ones who don't get it?\nSo it's this here, this little gap\nthat you have to close,\nas Jeffrey Moore calls it,\n\"Crossing the Chasm\" --\nbecause, you see, the early majority\nwill not try something\nuntil someone else has tried it first.\nAnd these guys, the innovators\nand the early adopters,\nthey're comfortable\nmaking those gut decisions.\nThey're more comfortable\nmaking those intuitive decisions\nthat are driven by what\nthey believe about the world\nand not just what product is available.\nThese are the people who stood\nin line for six hours\nto buy an iPhone when they first came out,\nwhen you could have bought one\noff the shelf the next week.\nThese are the people\nwho spent 40,000 dollars\non flat-screen TVs\nwhen they first came out,\neven though the technology\nwas substandard.\nAnd, by the way, they didn't do it\nbecause the technology was so great;\nthey did it for themselves.\nIt's because they wanted to be first.\nPeople don't buy what you do;\nthey buy why you do it\nand what you do simply proves\nwhat you believe.\nIn fact, people will do the things\nthat prove what they believe.\nThe reason that person bought the iPhone\nin the first six hours,\nstood in line for six hours,\nwas because of what they believed\nabout the world,\nand how they wanted everybody to see them:\nthey were first.\nPeople don't buy what you do;\nthey buy why you do it.\nSo let me give you a famous example,\na famous failure and a famous success\nof the law of diffusion of innovation.\nFirst, the famous failure.\nIt's a commercial example.\nAs we said before, the recipe for success\nis money and the right people\nand the right market conditions.\nYou should have success then.\nLook at TiVo.\nFrom the time TiVo came out\nabout eight or nine years ago\nto this current day,\nthey are the single highest-quality\nproduct on the market,\nhands down, there is no dispute.\nThey were extremely well-funded.\nMarket conditions were fantastic.\nI mean, we use TiVo as verb.\nI TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk\nTime Warner DVR all the time.\n(Laughter)\nBut TiVo's a commercial failure.\nThey've never made money.\nAnd when they went IPO,\ntheir stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars\nand then plummeted,\nand it's never traded above 10.\nIn fact, I don't think\nit's even traded above six,\nexcept for a couple of little spikes.\nBecause you see, when TiVo\nlaunched their product,\nthey told us all what they had.\nThey said, \"We have a product\nthat pauses live TV,\nskips commercials, rewinds live TV\nand memorizes your viewing habits\nwithout you even asking.\"\nAnd the cynical majority said,\n\"We don't believe you.\nWe don't need it. We don't like it.\nYou're scaring us.\"\nWhat if they had said,\n\"If you're the kind of person\nwho likes to have total control\nover every aspect of your life,\nboy, do we have a product for you.\nIt pauses live TV, skips commercials,\nmemorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc.\"\nPeople don't buy what you do;\nthey buy why you do it,\nand what you do simply serves\nas the proof of what you believe.\nNow let me give you a successful example\nof the law of diffusion of innovation.\nIn the summer of 1963,\n250,000 people showed up\non the mall in Washington\nto hear Dr. King speak.\nThey sent out no invitations,\nand there was no website\nto check the date.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, Dr. King\nwasn't the only man in America\nwho was a great orator.\nHe wasn't the only man\nin America who suffered\nin a pre-civil rights America.\nIn fact, some of his ideas were bad.\nBut he had a gift.\nHe didn't go around telling people\nwhat needed to change in America.\nHe went around\nand told people what he believed.\n\"I believe, I believe, I believe,\"\nhe told people.\nAnd people who believed what he believed\ntook his cause, and they made it\ntheir own, and they told people.\nAnd some of those people\ncreated structures\nto get the word out to even more people.\nAnd lo and behold,\n250,000 people showed up\non the right day at the right time\nto hear him speak.\nHow many of them showed up for him?\nZero.\nThey showed up for themselves.\nIt's what they believed about America\nthat got them to travel\nin a bus for eight hours\nto stand in the sun in Washington\nin the middle of August.\nIt's what they believed,\nand it wasn't about black versus white:\n25% of the audience was white.\nDr. King believed that there are\ntwo types of laws in this world:\nthose that are made by a higher authority\nand those that are made by men.\nAnd not until all the laws\nthat are made by men\nare consistent with the laws\nmade by the higher authority\nwill we live in a just world.\nIt just so happened\nthat the Civil Rights Movement\nwas the perfect thing to help him\nbring his cause to life.\nWe followed, not for him,\nbut for ourselves.\nBy the way, he gave\nthe \"I have a dream\" speech,\nnot the \"I have a plan\" speech.\n(Laughter)\nListen to politicians now,\nwith their comprehensive 12-point plans.\nThey're not inspiring anybody.\nBecause there are leaders\nand there are those who lead.\nLeaders hold a position\nof power or authority,\nbut those who lead inspire us.\nWhether they're individuals\nor organizations,\nwe follow those who lead,\nnot because we have to,\nbut because we want to.\nWe follow those who lead, not for them,\nbut for ourselves.\nAnd it's those who start with \"why\"\nthat have the ability\nto inspire those around them\nor find others who inspire them.\nThank you very much.\n(Applause)","language":"en","available_languages":[],"error":null}
